## Remaining Issue

My only remaining issue is now all <Link /> components point to the non-html url.

I guess I'll have to create my own <HtmlLink /> or <PostLink /> component that handles linking to html posts, with the same source I used for getStaticPaths.

It will have to smart enough to know the difference in the dev server (isDev) and rendering output. Because the dev server doesn't allow .html !!! Argh.
